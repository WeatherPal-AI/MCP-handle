## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitations

**Please read this carefully before using the Figma MCP Server:**

### Major API Limitations
1. **No Team/Project Discovery**: The Figma API does not provide endpoints to list teams or projects that a user has access to
2. **Manual ID Collection Required**: Users must manually provide:
   - **Team IDs** (from team URLs: `https://www.figma.com/files/team/{team_id}/`)
   - **Project IDs** (from project pages)
   - **File Keys** (from file URLs: `https://www.figma.com/file/{file_key}/filename`)

### Workarounds
- **File Keys**: Extract from Figma URLs: `https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123DEF456/My-Design` ‚Üí file_key is `ABC123DEF456`
- **Team IDs**: Found in team URLs: `https://www.figma.com/files/team/123456789/` ‚Üí team_id is `123456789`
- **Project IDs**: Available through the team projects endpoint once you have a team ID

## üìß Prerequisites

You'll need one of the following:

- **Docker:** Docker installed and running (recommended)
- **Python:** Python 3.12+ with pip

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

### Figma API Key Setup

1. **Log into your Figma account**:
   - Navigate to [Figma Settings](https://www.figma.com/settings)
   - Go to "Account" tab

2. **Generate a Personal Access Token**:
   - Scroll down to "Personal access tokens"
   - Click "Create new token"
   - Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "MCP Server Integration")
   - Select appropriate scopes (see below)
   - Click "Create token"
   - **Important**: Copy the generated token immediately and store it securely
   - You won't be able to see the full token again after this step

3. **Required Scopes**:
   For full functionality, your token should have these scopes:
   - `files:read` - Read file content
   - `file_variables:read` - Read variables
   - `file_variables:write` - Write variables  
   - `file_dev_resources:read` - Read dev resources
   - `file_dev_resources:write` - Write dev resources
   - `file_comments:read` - Read comments
   - `file_comments:write` - Write comments
   - `library_analytics:read` - Read library analytics
   - `webhooks:write` - Manage webhooks

### Environment Configuration

1. **Create your environment file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` file** with your Figma credentials:
   ```
   FIGMA_API_KEY=your_actual_figma_personal_access_token_here
   FIGMA_MCP_SERVER_PORT=5002
   ```

   **Important**: Replace `your_actual_figma_personal_access_token_here` with your actual token from step 2 above.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Server

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The Docker build must be run from the project root directory (`mcp_handle/`):

```bash
# Navigate to the root directory of the project
cd /path/to/mcp_handle

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t figma-mcp-server -f mcp_servers/figma/Dockerfile .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 5002:5002 --name figma-mcp figma-mcp-server
```

To use your local .env file instead of building it into the image:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5002:5002 --env-file mcp_servers/figma/.env --name figma-mcp figma-mcp-server
```

### Option 2: Python Virtual Environment

```bash
# Navigate to the Figma server directory
cd mcp_servers/figma

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
python server.py
```

Once running, the server will be accessible at `http://localhost:5002`.

## üîå API Usage

The server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard. Here's an example of how to call a tool:

```python
import httpx

async def call_figma_tool():
    url = "http://localhost:5002/mcp"
    payload = {
        "tool_name": "figma_get_file",
        "tool_args": {
            "file_key": "ABC123DEF456",
            "depth": 1
        }
    }
    
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(url, json=payload)
        result = response.json()
        return result
```

## üìã Common Operations

### Testing Connection

```python
payload = {
    "tool_name": "figma_test_connection",
    "tool_args": {}
}
```

### Getting File Content

```python
payload = {
    "tool_name": "figma_get_file",
    "tool_args": {
        "file_key": "ABC123DEF456",  # Extract from Figma URL
        "depth": 2,
        "geometry": "paths"
    }
}
```

### Exporting Images

    "tool_name": "figma_get_file_images",
    "tool_args": {
        "file_key": "ABC123DEF456",
        "ids": "123:456,789:012",  # Node IDs from the file
        "format": "png",
        "scale": 2
    }
}
```

### Getting Team Projects (Requires Team ID)

                "resolvedType": "COLOR"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Authentication Failures**: 
  - Verify your Personal Access Token is correct and hasn't expired
  - Ensure your token has the required scopes for the operations you're trying to perform
  - Check that your token hasn't been revoked in Figma settings

- **Missing Team/Project IDs**: 
  - Extract team IDs from Figma team URLs manually
  - Use the `figma_get_team_projects` endpoint to discover project IDs
  - File keys can be found in any Figma file URL

- **File Access Errors**: 
  - Ensure you have proper permissions to access the file/team/project
  - Some operations require edit permissions, not just view permissions
  - Files in private teams may not be accessible with personal access tokens

- **Rate Limiting**: 
  - Figma enforces rate limits based on your plan and authentication method
  - Personal access tokens have per-user limits
  - OAuth applications have global application limits
  - Implement appropriate delays between requests if hitting limits

- **Node ID Issues**: 
  - Node IDs change when files are modified
  - Use the file structure from `figma_get_file` to find current node IDs
  - Node IDs are strings like "123:456" not just numbers

### Docker Build Issues

- **File Not Found Errors**: If you see errors during Docker build, make sure you're building from the root project directory (`mcp_handle/`), not from the server directory.

### Finding Required IDs

**To find File Keys:**
```
Figma URL: https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123DEF456/My-Design-File
File Key: ABC123DEF456
```

**To find Team IDs:**
```
Team URL: https://www.figma.com/files/team/123456789/Team-Name
Team ID: 123456789
```

**To find Node IDs:**
1. Use `figma_get_file` to get the file structure
2. Navigate through the document tree to find specific nodes
3. Each node has an `id` field that you can use for other operations

## üìä API Limits and Best Practices

### Rate Limits
- **Personal Access Tokens**: Per-user limits (varies by plan)
- **OAuth Applications**: Global application limits
- **Enterprise Plans**: Higher limits available

### Best Practices
- **Cache File Data**: File content doesn't change frequently, cache when possible
- **Use Specific Node IDs**: Instead of getting entire files, request specific nodes when possible
- **Batch Operations**: Group related operations to minimize API calls
- **Error Handling**: Always implement proper error handling for API calls
- **Respect Rate Limits**: Monitor response headers for rate limit information
