# MCP Handle AI Discord Bot (MCP Client) - Local Development

This document provides instructions for setting up and running the MCP Handle AI Discord Bot locally for development and testing purposes. This bot acts as a client for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing users to interact with connected MCP servers and utilize their tools through Discord.

**Note:** This README is intended for developers or users who want to run the bot on their own machine. For regular use, please invite the official MCP Handle AI bot available through [www.mcp-handle.dev](https://www.mcp-handle.dev). The local development version runs with `USE_PRODUCTION_DB=False`, which uses local configuration files and might have different behavior or features compared to the hosted production bot (e.g., user verification is skipped).

## Prerequisites

- **Python:** Version 3.12 or higher.
- **uv:** Version 0.6.14 or higher.
- **Docker:** Recommended for easiest setup and execution. ([Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- **Git:** For cloning the repository.
- **Discord Bot Token:** You need to create a Discord application and bot user to get a token. See [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url> # Replace with the actual URL
    cd mcp_handle/mcp-clients # Navigate to the root directory of the project
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables:**

    - Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of mcp-clients (`mcp_handle/mcp-clients`).
    - Copy the example below and fill in your specific values:

    ```ini
    # .env example
    DISCORD_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
    WEBSITE_URL="https://www.mcp-handle.dev" # Or http://localhost:3000 if running web UI locally
    OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" # Needed for the default LLM in local mode

    # Optional: Set to true to use production database (NOT recommended for local dev)
    # USE_PRODUCTION_DB=False
    ```

    - Replace `"YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"` with the token obtained from the Discord Developer Portal.
    - Replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your OpenAI API key. Local development mode defaults to using an OpenAI model (`gpt-4o`).
    - `WEBSITE_URL` is used for generating login links (though login is bypassed in local mode). Point it to the production site or your local web UI instance.
    - `USE_PRODUCTION_DB` defaults to `False` if omitted, which is the correct setting for local development.

3.  **Local MCP Servers Configuration:**

    - When running locally (`USE_PRODUCTION_DB=False`), the bot reads the list of MCP server URLs to connect to from `src/mcp_clients/local_mcp_servers.json`.
    - Create this file if it doesn't exist.
    - Add the URLs of the MCP servers you want the local bot to connect to.

    ```json
    // mcp_clients/local_mcp_servers.json example
    {
      "server_urls": [
        "http://localhost:8000/sse"
        // Add other local or remote MCP server SSE endpoints here
      ]
    }
    ```

    - Replace `http://localhost:8000/sse` with the actual URL of your running MCP server(s).

## Running the Bot

You can run the bot using Docker (recommended) or directly with Python in a virtual environment. Make sure you are in the `mcp_handle/mcp-clients` root directory.

### Method 1: Docker (Recommended)

1.  **Build the Docker Image:**

    ```bash
    # Make sure that docker daemon is running before executing the command
    docker build -t mcp_handle-discord-bot -f Dockerfile.discord .
    ```

    _(**Note:** The `.` at the end is important - it specifies the build context as the current directory)_

2.  **Run the Docker Container:**
    This command runs the bot using the environment variables from your `.env` file and mounts your local `local_mcp_servers.json` into the container.

    ```bash
    docker run --rm --env-file .env -v ./src/mcp_clients/local_mcp_servers.json:/app/src/mcp_clients/local_mcp_servers.json mcp_handle-discord-bot
    ```

    - `--rm`: Automatically removes the container when it exits.
    - `--env-file .env`: Loads environment variables from the `.env` file in your current directory (`mcp_handle`).
    - `-v ./src/mcp_clients/local_mcp_servers.json:/app/local_mcp_servers.json`: Mounts your local JSON config into the expected path (`/app/src/mcp_clients/local_mcp_servers.json`) inside the container.

    _(**Note:** If you encounter an error at this step, it may be due to the use of quotes in the `.env` file. Try removing all the quotes and run the command again. For example: change `DISCORD_TOKEN="<token>"` to `DISCORD_TOKEN=<token>`.)_

### Method 2: Python Virtual Environment

1.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    # Make sure to navigate to the root directory of the project (skip if already done)
    cd mcp_handle/mcp-clients
    ```

    ```bash
    # Create environment (only needs to be done once)
    uv venv

    # Activate environment
    # Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux (bash/zsh):
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

3.  **Run the Bot:**
    Ensure your `.env` file exists in the `mcp_handle/mcp-clients` root and `src/mcp_clients/local_mcp_servers.json` is configured.
    ```bash
    uv run discord_bot
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Invite the Bot:** Go to your Discord application in the Developer Portal, navigate to the "OAuth2" > "URL Generator" section. Select the `bot` and `application.commands` scopes. Choose necessary permissions (e.g., `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Embed Links`, `Create Public Threads`). Copy the generated URL and use it to invite the bot to your test server.
2.  **Interact:**
    - Mention the bot in a channel: `@YourBotName your query here`
    - Send a Direct Message (DM) to the bot.
    - When first interacting, the bot might send a message about linking your account (using the `WEBSITE_URL`). In local mode (`USE_PRODUCTION_DB=False`), user verification is skipped, so you can proceed to interact with the bot directly.
    - The bot will connect to the MCP servers listed in `local_mcp_servers.json`, process your query using the configured LLM (OpenAI by default locally), and potentially use tools from the connected servers to respond.

## Development Notes

- The bot uses `asyncio` for asynchronous operations.
- Logging is directed to the standard output/console.
- Key libraries include `discord.py` (Discord interaction), `mcp-client` (MCP communication), `python-dotenv` (environment variables), `openai`/`anthropic` (LLM interaction).
- Refer to `discord_bot.py`, `base_bot.py`, and `mcp_client.py` for core logic.
