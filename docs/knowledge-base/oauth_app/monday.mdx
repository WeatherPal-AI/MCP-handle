## Prerequisites

- Monday.com account (admin access recommended)

## Step 1: Create a Monday App & Get Credentials

1. Log in to [Monday.com](https://monday.com)
2. Click your **avatar (top-right)** → **Developers**
3. In the Developer Console, click **Create App**
4. Once the app is created, you can immediately see the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
5. Copy both and keep them safe

<Check>
You now have your Monday.com **Client ID** and **Client Secret** ready for integration with MCP Handle AI.
</Check>

## Step 2: Configure OAuth & Permissions
<Note>
MCP Handle Monday MCP Server typically uses:
`users:read, boards:read, boards:write, updates:write`
</Note>

1. Open your app → go to **OAuth & Permissions**

2. Under **Scopes**, select the permissions your app requires.

3. Under **Redirect URLs**, add:

   ```
   https://api.mcp-handle.dev/oauth/monday/callback
   ```

## Step 3: Promote to Live

1. Once everything is set up, click **Promote to Live**.
Your app will now have permanent credentials and can be used in production

<Check>
You have successfully created Monday.com OAuth application! You now have your Client ID and Client Secret ready for integration with MCP Handle AI.
</Check>

## (Optional) Step 4: White Labeling

<Note>
White labeling lets you use your own Monday.com OAuth app branding instead of MCP Handle AI’s default.
</Note>

To use your own OAuth app:

1. Go to [MCP Handle White Label Dashboard](https://www.mcp-handle.dev/home/white-label)

2. Enter your **Monday Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Step 1

3. Confirm the redirect URI:

   ```
   https://api.mcp-handle.dev/oauth/monday/callback
   ```

4. Start the OAuth flow with your client ID:

   ```javascript
   const authUrl = `https://api.mcp-handle.dev/oauth/monday/authorize?instance_id=${instanceId}&client_id=${yourClientId}`;
   ```
