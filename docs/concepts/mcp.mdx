# What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that unifies how AI models communicate with external tools and services. It acts as a bridge between Large Language Models (LLMs) and the real world, enabling AI agents to interact with databases, APIs, files, and other systems in a standardized way.

## How MCP Works

MCP follows a simple **client-server architecture**:

- **MCP Client**: The AI assistant or application (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or your custom AI agent)
- **MCP Server**: A specialized backend that exposes tools to interact with external systems
- **Tools**: Individual functions that the AI can call to perform specific actions

    C -->|Result| B
    B -->|Context| A
```
